Subject: Request for Extension - Campaign Executive - Assignment

Dear Account Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to meet the original due date of Tomorrowâ€™s Date for the Campaign Executive - Assignment due to a family emergency.

As a result, I would like to request an extension of three days to complete the task. I understand the impact this may have on our plans, and I assure you that I will work diligently to complete the project as soon as possible.

Please let me know if this extension is possible and if there is anything I can do to support you during this time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I appreciate your understanding.

As I have already completed a large portion of the illustrations,I was supposed to submit the project on Feb. 6, but I will appreciate it if you can extend the deadline to Feb. 9. That will give me sufficient to finish the final part.

Thank you in advance for your consideration of my situation.

Best regards,

Shaik Shakeer
